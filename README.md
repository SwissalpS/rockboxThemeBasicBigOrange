# Basic Big Orange Rockbox Theme by SwissalpS

## Description
A theme for iPod Nano 2nd Gen running [rockbox](https://rockbox.org) version 4.0  
The focus of this theme is on large text for elderly and otherwise vision impaired folks or those who like big fonts.  

Cabbie v2 served as starting point and lends the icons in the WPS screen. Menu icons are not included in this project, they are recycled from tango icons set.  
All the fonts are taken from the v4.0 font collection.
